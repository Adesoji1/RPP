# Hey, I'm Adesoji Alu!

Recently, I was the architect of Sortol's company website deployment [Sortolng](https://sortolng.com) written in Front end and backend frameworks ✨. This whole journey began with a quest for knowledge when i stumbled upon Artificial Intelligence [AI](https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) 🤏. Before that,and till now, I like pen down my thoughts on medium and on DEV [`Dev`](https://dev.to/adesoji1/how-to-become-a-devops-professional-in-2023-717) and [`Medium`](https://systemweakness.com/introduction-to-aws-amazon-guardduty-10391f7c1a9a).

The space between development,Testing and deployment is where I thrive. Of all three models, the best model is the model named ** first model** . Further training  of the Third model, couple with additional data would make it robust. Further more, Both first model and second model can de deployed.
